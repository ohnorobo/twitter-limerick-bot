Who said to his girl, "You're a tight one."
She replied, "Bless my soul,
You're in the wrong hole;
There's plenty of room in the right one."

And cut off its beard, willy-nilly

A Chilean chinchilla's chin chilly

"A chemist has poisoned my brain!"

A UNIX sales lady, Lenore,
Enjoys work, but she likes the beach more.
She found a good way
To combine work and play:
She sells C shells by the seashore.

Owns a still of exquisite construction.

Through magnetic coils.
She says that it's "proof by induction."

Whose [body part] was [special case].

A preoccupied vegan named Hugh
Picked up the wrong sandwich to chew.
He took a big bite
before spitting, in fright,
"OMG, WTF, BBQ!"

There once was a buggy AI
Who decided her subject should die.
When the plot was uncovered,
The subjected discovered
That sadly the cake was a lie.
